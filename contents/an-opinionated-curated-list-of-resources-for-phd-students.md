  A curated list of resources for Ph.D. students. It includes both academic
  resources mainly for Computer Science or Engineering students and other
  resources (e.g., personal development, communication, and writing) that I
  personally feel useful and needed during my Ph.D. time.

### Open source community

It is always good to participate in open source projects, while we all have benefited a lot from the open source work accomplished by others. During your Ph.D. life, you may find that all the programming scripts you've written for your research projects can be turned into some reusable open source software packages to be shared with others, and at the same time get some citation impact on the work that uses your software packages. Here are some good venues you may consider to publish your open source software packages.

## Live as a Ph.D. student

### Personality and habits

* [Learning to think: Becoming a functional PhD student](https://medium.com/@OAlannah/learning-to-think-becoming-a-functional-phd-student-7706f33cf22e)

* [NirandFar](https://www.nirandfar.com/) This is official website of the author Nir Eyal, who has published famous books (e.g., hooked) about *behaviorial design* that may be used in mobile app design. The book was originally recommended by my advisor during the course. Regardless of using the idea in app design, I find it is also important to understand how our brains and behaviors are affected by the technologies around us, both the positive and the negative sides. It is especially important for STEM Ph.D. students to be aware of the impact, because our lives are about creating new technical gadgets and concepts and are literally surrounded by them.

### Communication matters

* [How to take criticism well](https://hbr.org/2019/04/how-to-take-criticism-well) An article about how to communicate in tough situations (e.g., rebuked by your advisor) written by Sabina Nawaz, who is a famouse leadership coach. I once participated in her PhD communication training workshop at Northeastern.

It is about getting what you want from your advisor. This seems to be universally useful in all management relationships.

* [Does your philosophy of science matter in practice?](http://daniellakens.blogspot.com/2019/01/does-your-philosophy-of-science-matter.html)

### Presentation

* [How to create a better research poster in less time?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=292&v=1RwJbhkCA58)

### Listen to the researchers

### Identify impact of papers[^1]

I will exclude well-known Google Scholar, and Microsoft Academic Search from the list because these are not indexing services and do not exclude predatory journals and conferences.

Web of Science is excluded because this requires subscription. But your school should usually have the subscription. And its citation report is probably the most reliable service to find impactful journals.

* [dimensions.ai](dimensions.ai) Provide a better full picture of how the publications are connected with others and other domains.
* [Leiden Manifesto for research metrics](http://www.leidenmanifesto.org) "10 principles to guide research evaluation". This is about addressing current issues in publication evaluuation.
* [Think. Check. Submit](https://thinkchecksubmit.org/) A neat website helps researchers choose the right trustworthy journals or conferences to publish through a well-organized questionnaire.
* [Directory of open access journals](https://doaj.org/) Search and verify if an open source journal is actually certified.
* [Beall's list of predatory journals and publishers](https://beallslist.weebly.com/) You know by its name.

[^1]: This section extracts information from two webinar talks: [How can I organize and manage my digital stuff](https://nuonline.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/t/1_olizfjzy), [How can I avoid predatory journals and publishers](https://nuonline.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/t/0_odez1m0t) and [How can I determine how impactful my research is](https://nuonline.mediaspace.kaltura.com/media/t/1_mm58p2ln) from Northeastern University Library Service.

### Write an impactful paper

* [How to Craft Your Article Title to Increase Views and Citations](https://www.acsm.org/home/featured-blogs---homepage/acsm-blog/2019/11/04/how-to-craft-your-article-title-increase-views-citations) It all starts with a good title that, according to Prof. Roger M. Enoka, can boost the citations and views of your paper.
* [Hemingway editor](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) I found this online editor is extremely helpful for checking readabilities, especially you use it together with Grammarly. The online editor is free.
