# About me

Qu Tang, S.M., is a sixth year Ph.D. student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Northeastern University, Boston, USA. His research focuses on the development of mobile health systems that integrate ideas from ubiquitous computing, machine learning, exercise science, and algorithms. Areas of special interest include algorithms for automated recognition of human behaviors using wearable sensors, and mobile technologies for measuring longitudinal human behaviors via biomarkers (e.g., motion, heart rate, etc).

Mr. Tang received his S.M. from Northeastern University in 2013 working on developing activity recognition algorithms at mHealth Research Group, and a B.S.E. degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2010. He has published research on activity recognition, physical behavior measurement using accelerometers, and real-time system for measuring human behaviors. Mr. Tang has been serving as a reviewer for conferences and journals including IMWUT, Sensors, and JMIR.
