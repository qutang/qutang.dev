The website hosts my projects, posts and contact information. It is built using [sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev) + [svelte](https://svelte.dev) + [netlify](https://netlify.com) stack.

This website supports,

1. Internalization in Chinese.
2. Netlify CMS.
3. Netlify identity.
4. Pagination.
5. Mailchimp subscription.
6. Post categorization.
7. sitemap + rss
8. markdown + jupyter notebook

**Disclaimer: The website is developed in harsh (literally THREE days), codes are not well organized. Use it with caution.**

# Future direction

So far I'm happy with the SSN (sapper + svelte + netlify) stack, so I will stay with them for quite a while. My primary work is done in Python, so forgive me about my bad JS coding skills.

A little story to share, my tech trajectory in terms of building personal website,

    Wordpress in Php
    Jekyll in Ruby
    Hexo in JS
    Charge in React
    Sapper in Svelte

I think Sapper makes the most sense, thanks to Rich Harris.
